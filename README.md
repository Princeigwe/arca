# Arca: Self-Sovereign Health



> A smart contract system that puts patients in full control of their medical records - providers request access, patients decide who sees what.

---


## Overview

In traditional healthcare, patient data is siloed across institutions and accessed without meaningful patient consent. **Arca** is an Ethereum-based EHR (Electronic Health Record) system that flips that model.

Patients own their records. Medical providers register on-chain and formally request access. Patients approve or reject those requests. All permissions are transparent, auditable, and enforced by smart contracts - no middlemen, no assumptions.



Arca also handles real-world edge cases: patients can link multiple wallet addresses to their profile, and underage patients can be managed by a designated guardian.
